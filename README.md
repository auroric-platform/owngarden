# OwnGarden Reloaded
OwnGarden reloaded builds on the foundation of the original OwnGarden, allowing you to grow a custom tree from schematic that replaces the default trees when you plant and grow it, or bonemeal it.

Well, it is simple : first you have to plant a sapling (any type you want). Then let it grows or use some bonemeal. When the sapling is ready to become a tree, the plugin replaces the horrible default Minecraft tree by a nice custom schematic. 
The custom schematic is randomly picked from a list (where you can add, remove or edit available schematics per sapling type).

## üîó Requirement
OwnGarden Reloaded requires WorldEdit or FAWE installed on your server.

## Configuration
Your server must be stopped before editing **config.yml**.
